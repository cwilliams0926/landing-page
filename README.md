This is the landing page project for the Odin Project's Foundations course.

# How it's made
**Tech Used**: HTML and CSS

This project was pretty lengthy and took me around a week to complete, working on it for roughly 1-2 hours a day. My approach was to do the project top down, doing each section one at a time. I worked on the html for each section before going to the CSS. The first section, the hero section, was the hardest part for me. Getting the alignment working right was difficult. I separated the header and hero content into two different flexboxes and made their flex-direction set to column, so they'd stack on top of each other. Looking back on this, I could have achieved the same thing by just making the header and hero sections two separate sections.

I followed the styling values in the 02.png file of the project page for the font sizes, colors, and button stuff. The whole point of the project was to make it look as much like the 01.png file as possible, and I think I achieved that pretty well.

# Lessons learned
This project put all of the things I had learned about flexbox up to this point to the test. It was my first time making what I consider to be "a real webpage." I also learned a few details that the Odin lessons up to this point didn't teach, such as importing fonts or making rounded corners. I'm happy with the end result and I feel like I learned a lot making this thing.
